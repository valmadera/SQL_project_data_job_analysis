# ✨Background
As a chemical engineer looking to turn to data analysis, I wanted to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively. This project was born from a desire to learn while highlighting top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining my research to find optimal opportunities.

Luke Barousee offers a great opportunity to get both on his YouTube course, where he helps people like me achieve this goal by showcasing the skills we learned at the same that we can thoroughly understand the data analysis job market. 

Data hails from Luke's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It is packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying remote jobs in data analysis?
2. What are the top skills for any remote job in data analysis?
3. In which countries are the top-paying opportunities for any remote job in data analysis? What are their demand?
4. What are the most in-demand skills for a remote Data Analyst?
5. What are the top skills based on salary for a remote Data Analyst?
6. What are the most optimal skills to learn as a remote Data Analyst?

# 🔧Tools I Used
- **SQL ➡️** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and get insights.
- **PostgresSQL ➡️** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job post data.
- **Visual Studio Code ➡️** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Microsoft EXCEL ➡️** My loyal visualization tool for small data sets.
- **Git & Github ➡️** Essential for version control and showcasing my SQL script and analysis.

# 📶The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here is how I approached each question:

### 1. What are the top-paying remote jobs?
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analysis positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field, regardless of experience, where these job postings were made, and where I could apply for them.

```sql 
SELECT
    job_title,
    name,
    job_country,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_via
FROM
    job_postings_fact 
    INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 
    10;
```

Here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **LinkedIn opportunities:** These job opportunities are in this platform, which enhances the importance of having a well-crafted LinkedIn profile.
- **Keep learning** Top paying roles belong to Data Scientists and Data Engineers.
- **Diverse of roles:** There is a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.
- **Diverse employers:** 8 out of 10 job postings are from the United States with companies like Selby Jennings, Algo Capital Group, Engtal, and Meta showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $325,000 to $550,000 indicating significant salary potential in the field.

### 2. What are the top skills for any remote job in Data Analysis?
To identify the top skills for remote jobs I created a temporary table of job postings joined with the skills tables where skills would be related to job postings' requests. This query counts the number of job postings asking for each skill, providing insight into the top 5 most requested and their associated average salaries. 

```sql
-- CTE
WITH job_skills AS (
    SELECT 
        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_title,
        skills,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact 
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    )

--Query
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT (skills) AS count_of_requested_skill,
    ROUND (AVG (salary_year_avg),0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_skills
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    count_of_requested_skill DESC
LIMIT
     5;
```

Here is the breakdown of the top skills for jobs in 2023:

- **Python and SQL:** These skills were the most requested with around 2,180 requests, showing the importance of SQL.
- **Programming tools:** When your nich is this, better learn Python and then R since Python has three times more requests.
- **Cloud computing** The third most in-demand and best-paid skill is AWS, a cloud computing service, which states the increasing use of cloud services and the opportunity behind it.
- **Visualization tools:** If you had to choose the most sought tool for this purpose, Tableau is probably the best option to start with.

### 3. In which countries are the top-paying opportunities for any remote job in data analysis? What are their demand?
To identify the top-paying countries for remote jobs in the field I filtered by country, where the count of offers was over 4, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying countries, regardless of job position.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_country,
    COUNT (job_country) AS number_of_jobs,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg),0) AS average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact 
    INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    job_country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    job_country
HAVING
    COUNT (job_country) > 4
ORDER BY
    average_salary DESC,
    number_of_jobs
LIMIT 10;
```
Here is the breakdown of the top skills for jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** The country's average salaries span from $84,500 to $182,900 indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Python and SQL:** These skills were the most requested with around 2,180 requests, showing the importance of SQL.
