# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job mmarket more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs. 

Data hails from my [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It is packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying remote jobs?
2. What are the top skills for any remote job in Data Analysis?
3. Where (Countries) are the top-paying jobs for any job in Data Analysis? What are their demand?
4. What are the most in-demand skills for a Data Analyst?
5. What are the top skills based on salary for a Data Analyst?
6. What are the most optimal skills to learn (High demand & high paying)?
