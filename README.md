# Background
As a chemical engineer looking to turn to data analysis, I wanted to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively. This project was born from a desire to learn while highlighting top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining my research to find optimal opportunities.

Luke Barousee offers a great opportunity to get both on his YouTube course, where he helps people like me achieve this goal by showcasing the skills we learned at the same that we can thoroughly understand the data analysis job market. 

Data hails from Luke's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It is packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying remote jobs?
2. What are the top skills for any remote job in Data Analysis?
3. Where (Countries) are the top-paying jobs for any job in Data Analysis? What are their demand?
4. What are the most in-demand skills for a Data Analyst?
5. What are the top skills based on salary for a Data Analyst?
6. What are the most optimal skills to learn (High demand & high paying)?

# Tools I Used
- **SQL ->** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgresSQL ->** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job post data.
- **Visual Studio Code ->** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github ->** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL script and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here is how I approached each question:

### 1. What are the top-paying remote jobs?
To identify the highest-paying roles I filteres data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql 
SELECT
    job_title,
    name,
    job_country,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_via
FROM
    job_postings_fact 
    INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 
    10;
```

Here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000 indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Wide Salary Range:** There is a high diversity in job title, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. What are the top skills for any remote job in Data Analysis?

```sql
-- CTE
WITH job_skills AS (
    SELECT 
        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_title,
        skills,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM
        job_postings_fact 
        INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
        INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    )

--Query
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT (skills) AS count_of_requested_skill,
    ROUND (AVG (salary_year_avg),0) AS avg_salary
FROM
    job_skills
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    count_of_requested_skill DESC
