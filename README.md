# ‚ú®Background
As a chemical engineer looking to turn to data analysis, I wanted to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively. This project was born from a desire to learn while highlighting top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining my research to find optimal opportunities.

Luke Barousee offers a great opportunity to get both on his YouTube course, where he helps people like me achieve this goal by showcasing the skills we learned at the same that we can thoroughly understand the data analysis job market. 

Data hails from Luke's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It is packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying remote jobs in data analysis?
2. What are the top skills for any remote job in data analysis?
3. In which countries are the top-paying opportunities for any remote job in data analysis? What are their demand?
4. What are the most in-demand skills for a remote Data Analyst?
5. What are the top skills based on salary for a remote Data Analyst?
6. What are the most optimal skills to learn as a remote Data Analyst?

# üîßTools I Used
- **SQL ‚û°Ô∏è** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and get insights.
- **PostgresSQL ‚û°Ô∏è** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job post data.
- **Visual Studio Code ‚û°Ô∏è** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Microsoft EXCEL ‚û°Ô∏è** My loyal visualization tool for small data sets.
- **Git & Github ‚û°Ô∏è** Essential for version control and showcasing my SQL script and analysis.

# üì∂The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here is how I approached each question:

### 1. What are the top-paying remote jobs?
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analysis positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field, regardless of experience, where these job postings where made, and where I could apply for them.

```sql 
SELECT
    job_title,
    name,
    job_country,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_via
FROM
    job_postings_fact 
    INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 
    10;
```

Here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

- **LinkedIn opportunities:** These job opportunities are in this platform, which enhances the importance of having a well-crafted LinkedIn profile.
- **Keep learning** Top paying roles belong to Data Scientists and Data Engineers.
- **Diversity of roles:** There is a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $325,000 to $550,000 indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse employers:** 8 out of 10 job postings are from the United States with companies like Selby Jennings, Algo Capital Group, Engtal, and Meta showing a broad interest across different industries.
